										<h5>1. USER CONSENT AND DISCLAIMERS</h5>
										<br>
										<h6>1.1. USER CONSENT</h6>
										<small>By leaving contact information a User thereby agreeing to Meridian International Privacy Policy, the User hereby
											consents to the collection, use and disclosure of his Personal Data and Non-personal Data, as required by the Site,
											in accordance with this Data Privacy Policy document.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.2. TYPES OF DATA</h6>
										<small>A User’s Content can comprise two types of User data: “Personal Data” is used herein to refer to any data that allows
											someone to identify or contact an individual User; whereas “Non-personal Data” is used herein to refer to any data
											which does not, of itself, directly identify the individual User.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.3. MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT</h6>
										<small>Access to the Site and its services, products and contents are expressly forbidden to any persons under the age
											of 13; if any Personal Data (and/or Non-personal Data) is collected, used or disclosed by the Site on persons under
											the age of 13, then it is not done so intentionally. In the European Union, the age limitation is 16. Thus, if
											this jurisdiction applies to you, Meridian International will not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal
											information from children under age 16.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.4. DATA PERMISSION</h6>
										<small>In submitting any User Content to the Site, including Personal Data and Non-personal Data, the User hereby confirms
											that he has the authority to (and is further willing to): post the User Content on the Site; share the User Content
											with other (relevant) Users; and, where applicable, such as in the instance of Images, transfer the ownership of
											User Content to another User through the use of an Image Transfer Agreement. Where the User Content (both Personal
											Data and Non-personal Data) posted by a User in any way belongs to a third party, the User must absolutely comply
											with the first paragraph of provision 1.4. of this Data Privacy Policy document (above). Any loss in whatsoever
											form arising from the use of User Content in any way belonging to a third party will fall fully and solely on the
											User who posted that User Content.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.5. DATA STORAGE</h6>
										<small>Although all reasonable care will be taken by Meridian International in the protection of the Site’s contents, including
											its Personal Data and Non-personal Data, Meridian International can not guarantee their absolute security, and
											Meridian International is not liable for any loss of Personal Data and/or Non-personal Data and any loss in whatsoever
											form arising to any party(s) as a result of the loss of Personal Data and/or Non-personal Data. Meridian International
											is not obligated to backup any User Content, including Personal Data and Non-personal Data, and User Content may
											be deleted and/or lost at any time; the User should note that the responsibility to create backup copies of a User’s
											own Content, rests solely with the User himself.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.6. DATA MAINTENANCE</h6>
										<small>All Users are fully and solely responsible for the entirety of their User Content, including their Personal Data
											and Non-personal Data; it is the User’s responsibility to ensure that all their User Content, including their Personal
											Data and Non-personal Data is: accurate, complete, reliable, useful, appropriate, true and integral.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.7. DATA DELETION</h6>
										<small>User’s may delete their User Content, including Personal Data and Non-personal Data but should note that Meridian
											International may keep some or all of the User Content present in a User’s account and not delete it until a later
											stage (if ever), when all possible requirements linked to that User Content have been fulfilled (for example, with
											regards to the provision of services, for fraud prevention, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes,
											to help enforce agreements, etc.). When Meridian International deletes any User Content, including Personal Data
											and/or Non-personal Data, this User Content will be deleted from the active database but may remain in Meridian
											International archives; this archived version is in no way and under no circumstances intended to act as a backup,
											and is not available to any User, including the author (User) of the archived User Content. A User can delete their
											User account and their entire User Content, including Personal Data and Non-personal Data by emailing or calling
											Meridian International. Following the deletion of a User’s account by the User paragraphs one and two of provision
											1.7. of this Data Privacy Policy document will still apply.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>1.8. GENERAL DISCLAIMERS</h6>

										</small>
										<h5>2. PERSONAL DATA</h5>
										<br>
										<h6>2.1. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>“Personal Data” is used herein to refer to any data that allows someone to identify or contact an individual User;
											in the case of the Site, Personal Data is likely to include a User’s: name, surname, address, email, telephone
											number. The Site uses technology to automatically collect information from the User which does not, of itself,
											directly identify the individual User. Such information could include: data on the User’s visit to the Site (such
											as browser type, operating system, internet protocol address, domain name, location, language, time spent on site,
											date and time stamp of visit, etc.), which may be used by the Site to administer the Site, analyse User trends,
											track User movements around the Site, gather demographic information on Users, etc.; and also data on the User’s
											performance (such as sales and conversions data), which may be used by the Site to improve a User’s experience
											with the Site. Meridian International reserves the right to link such automatically collected information to a
											User’s Personal Data for the purpose of security and protecting the Site against fraudulent and/or non-professional
											activity on behalf of any User. The Site uses Google Analytics to collect data on Users, including the collection
											of cookies and user IDs; Users should refer to the following link for information on the data collected by Google
											Analytics: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/
											<br>
											<br> We will not upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual (such as name, Social Security
											Number, email address, or any similar data), or data that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a
											unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.2. USE OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>Personal Data is, in general, used by Meridian International to allow and subsequently improve the User’s and/or
											other Users’ experience with the Site. Meridian International uses Personal Data to: allow the creation of a single,
											secure User account which will allow the User access to the Site and its services; identify a User’s movements
											and interactions within the Site; inform internal research and development that could improve the Site and its
											services; customise the Site to match a User’s preferences; respond to a User’s request; send administrative notifications
											and promotional materials to Users; block Site access to suspended Users; marketing and surveys; sending service
											update notices; enabling sales and other transactions; processing payments and settlement; sending payouts; handling
											orders; providing receipts; providing customer service; providing dispute resolution, chargebacks, refunds, or
											related issues; recovering debt and collections; detecting and preventing fraud; detecting and preventing violations
											of our legal agreements; measuring, improving, and customizing our services; fulfilling other technical, financial,
											legal, compliance, administrative, or back office functions.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.3. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>The disclosure of Personal Data to other Users is kept to a minimum. The more sensitive elements of a User’s Personal
											Data (such as the User’s name, surname, address, email, telephone number) are visible solely to the User himself
											and Meridian International.
											<br>
											<br> Meridian International may have to disclose some or all of a User’s Personal Data to third party service providers
											so that Meridian International may, with the assistance of these third party service providers, deliver the Site’s
											services to the User. These third party service providers are required to use a User’s Personal Data solely to
											provide the services requested by Meridian International; any Personal Data in the possession of a third party
											service provider will be subject to that third party service provider’s own data privacy policy, and not Meridian
											International Data Privacy Policy document. Mailchimp, the third party professional email marketing platform currently
											used by the Site, collects and stores its own Personal Data through the Site. The Site’s programmer will also have
											access to the Site for the purpose of maintenance, revisions, updates, etc. Other disclosures of Personal Data
											may occur where Meridian International believes, in good faith, that such a disclosure is necessary, for example:
											in conjunction with any disputes, investigations and/or legal proceedings; in compliance with any relevant laws
											and regulations; in defence of Meridian International or any other Users’ rights and property; etc.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.4. STORAGE OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>Meridian International is committed to protecting the security of the Site’s contents, including a User’s Personal
											Data.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.5. MODIFYING PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>A User can modify their User Content, including Personal Data, through their User account. Any changes to Personal
											Data will require the User to be reapproved by Meridian International. Where a User intends to delete the entirety
											of his User Content by deleting his User account, then provision 1.7. of this Data Privacy Policy document applies
											in its entirety.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.6. TESTIMONIALS AND FEEDBACK</h6>
										<small>The Site allows all Users to supply feedback, testimonials and/or endorsements; any feedback is viewed solely by
											Meridian International, whilst testimonials and endorsements may be displayed on the Site along with the User’s
											name, unless said User wishes to remain anonymous, in which case the User’s avatar will be used. Once submitted,
											all feedback, testimonials and endorsements belong to Meridian International, but may be modified, updated and/or
											deleted by the author (User) by emailing or calling Meridian International.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>2.7. THIRD PARTIES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS</h6>
										<small>When a User follows a linked Site or advertisement from the Site and/or in any way leaves the Site, the User may
											end up on another Site and/or in contact with an entity other than Meridian International, which may decide to
											collect their own data from the User, including Personal Data. Meridian International Data Privacy Policy document
											will cease to apply the instant the User navigates away for the Site, including those instances where the User
											leaves the Site by following any link found on the Site and/or any prompt received by the Site; and the User will
											then be subject to that Site’s and/or entity’s own data privacy policy (whether or not that Site and/or entity
											has one), which Meridian International has in no way vetted or approved, and for which Meridian International accepts
											no responsibility in whatsoever form.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h5>3. NON-PERSONAL DATA</h5>
										<br>
										<h6>3.1. NON-PERSONAL USER DATA</h6>
										<small>In order to make full use of the Site and its services, the User will have to submit Non-personal Data, examples
											of which could include: any details as required by the Site’s web form; any detailed files; any information shared
											on the web form; etc. Non-personal Data is visible solely to the User and Meridian International.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>3.2. DATA OWNERSHIP</h6>
										<small>All User Content, including both Personal Data and Non-personal Data, as posted by a User belongs fully and solely
											to that User, including any intellectual property rights associated with that User Content and all the possible
											liabilities and/or responsibilities that come with such ownership of that User Content.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h6>3.3. STORAGE OF NON-PERSONAL DATA</h6>
										<small>Meridian International is committed to protecting the security of the Site’s contents, including a User’s Non-personal
											Data; the Site uses data hashing to protect a User’s data.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>
										<h5>4. COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY</h5>
										<small>This Site’s pages or e-mail messages may contain cookies, web beacons (also known as clear gifs), or similar technologies
											as they become available. Cookies are information files that this Site may place on your computer to provide extended
											functionality. The Meridian International may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns
											on the Site, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating
											your ability to navigate the Site and as part of a verification or screening process. Most browsers are initially
											set up to accept cookies. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance
											of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions, “Help”
											screen, or similar such resource to learn more about how to manage cookies and possibly reset your browser to refuse
											all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent by indicating this in the preferences, options, or similar
											such menu in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of this Site will not operate correctly if you
											disable cookies and you may not be able to take advantage of some of this Site’s features. You should consult with
											your browser’s provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.
											<br>
											<br> The Meridian International web pages may include advertisements for third parties and their products, and those
											third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. The Meridian International
											does not control cookies in such third party ads, and visitors are encouraged to check the privacy policies of
											advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The Meridian International
											Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information collected from you by third party ad servers. These companies
											may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to
											this and other Site’s in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services
											that may be of interest to you.
											<br>
											<br> A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain
											information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser
											requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon
											was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed
											as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. The Meridian International
											may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the Site or to monitor how our users navigate the Site,
											and the Meridian International may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent
											were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.
											<br>
										</small>
										<br>

										<small>Meridian International reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice to
											its Users on this page. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last
